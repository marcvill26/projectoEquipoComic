He decides hes going back to basics, putting away his high-tech toys and high-profile image so he can get his hands dirty again. Its time to dig into the guts of real machines, put on some old-fashioned metal and fly. But can he really lay that Stark-sized ego down? Life isnt that simple, something that old friends and frustrating foes are quick to point out. If you strip down a billionaire to his bolts, does he run solid or just overheat? Tonys going to find out once a threat to the entire universe rears its head from the past. As he suits up again, Tony remains sure of one thing: hes still IRON MAN down to his flesh and blood core.",
